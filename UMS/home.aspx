    <h2>The Institute Of Computer Technology</h2>
    <h2>Program Overview:</h2>
    <p>The rise in ‘real-world’ research and ‘learning by doing’ education has generated exciting opportunities with the 
	potential to shift higher education culture at Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) under the Faculty of Engineering & 
	Technology, Ganpat University. ICT’s provision for world class teaching and research is bolstered by an active engagement
	of industry experts. The Industry-Institute-Integration has resulted in ‘industry collaborated/sponsored courses’ and 
	setting up number of sponsored labs.</p>
    
    <p>In a fast changing world, technology is changing faster than our lives. Latest technologies are being adopted as an
	integral part of the world; determining greater employability of young engineers. As a continued effort to offer the 
	Programs-of-Future, Ganpat University provides an exclusive opportunity to the engineering aspirants to join Bachelor of 
	Technology (B.Tech.) and Master of Technology (M.Tech) - CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) in association with IBM.</p>

    <h2>The Collaboration :</h2> 
	<p>Starting in academic year 2014, Ganpat University (GNU), and IBM (under its Career Education program) have agreed to 
	launch Engineering programs with specialization using IBM Software. The aim is to develop sufficient industry needed skills
	for manpower on critical emerging technology area such as Cloud, Mobility, Big Data & Analytics.</p>

	<p>IBM - Career Education program is a holistic, comprehensive one with customized offerings for Engineering and Business 
	Schools, students and faculty members. The programs bring together the latest software content, real-world industry 
	experiences,hands-on lab courses, current practices and case studies for the participants to have engaged learning.</p>

	<p>IBM and GNU have collaborated to setup an IBM Software Lab for Emerging Technologies in the campus to help students and
	faculty members enhance their skills in areas of Big Data & Analytics, Cloud Computing, and Mobility. The industry 
	collaborated courses in association with IBM provide a unique platform to the students to have hands-on experience with 
	live projects, which are mentored by industry experts. This enables students to attain industry-readiness and transform 
	themselves into highly employable trained professionals.</p>
